**Aether is a anti-aliased UI engine for Minecraft**, and LWJGL projects (or anything really). You can create your own renderer implementation, or use the default implementation with *[NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg "An anti-aliased vector graphics library")*. It is desgined to be concise and very flexible. **The project is in early stages of development, many bugs may arise, and features might be lacking.**
